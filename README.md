# Rust: Find Duplicate Files

This project finds all duplicate files within a given directory and its subdirectories.

It uses the BLAKE3 algorithm to hash each file, then it compares all hashes to identify duplicates.

As a demo, it is set up to find duplicates in the `./src/text_files` directory.
